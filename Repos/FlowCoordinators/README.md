# FlowCoordinators
Implementation of Application Controller pattern in iOS and Swift

# Summary
This sample iOS app is written in Swift 3 and shows my interpretation of the Application Controller pattern described in Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture and several blog posts. All navigation flow in the app is handled by a set of coordinator objects (one per flow). The app uses standard push navigation for the signup process, and uses a custom navigation delegate and animation for accessing additional content from the Profile screen.
